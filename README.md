# test-4

Given the test_data1.csv file

create an interface to upload the csv file, and display the data in a clever way.

What we are looking for:
1) Sorting, graphs, analytics are all allowed. We want to see a useful way to view this data
2) we are looking for a single page application

Bonus points:
- we use React in house so Bonus for using it, but not a requirement
- ES6
- flux pattern
- immutable data structures
- functional programming
- scalable charts (test_data1 and test_data2 have debits between 1 and 100, test_data3 has debits between 1 and 10)
- works
